# Quality control


## Read a quality control output

1. How many reads you have?
2. What is the length of reads?
3. Is average quality per base the same along the length of read?
4. Are there any sequencing adapters present in the dataset?
5. Could you approximate a coverage we have given the length of the genome is 1.5 - 2.5 Mbp. For the calculation be conservative, compute the minimal coverage you have.

## Hands-on adapter search

Searching for adapter contamination is not that hard since, the sequences are actually known. If you dig into source code of fasqc, or check Illumina website, you can find seqeunces of adapters and usually you find an adapter matching your adapter contamination. Another aproach would be to check kmer frequencies. **We found that adapter of `data.fastq.gz` contains sequence `ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG`. **

1. To identify whole adapter sequence, you can select fulltext search in some subset of your reads (100000 lines). In the subset you use a fulltext search (grep) to find reads containing the adapter sequence (overrepresented kmer), select first one hundred of them and show them using `less`.

```bash
zcat <reads1.fastq.gz> | head -n 100000 | grep <overrepresented kmer> | head -n 100 | less
```

Command `less` allow you a fulltext search as well. Press `/` and copy-paste there the sequence `<overrepresented kmer>`, hit `Enter`. Now all `<overrepresented kmer>` sequences will be highlighted. Can you find a pattern? Do we know whole seqeuence of adapter or is it actually longer?

We will actually cut all possible adapters without specifying which one is in our sequence. Therefore we wont use the output of our little adapter investigaton.

# Adapter trimming and quality filtering

Later on, we are going to "glue" reads together into nice assembly, this process is rather complicated, therefore we need to help assembler as much as possible by giving it as good data as possible. Besides trimming of addapters, we can reduce number of errors by filtering and trimming reads according to quality. A one handy tool integrating all those read pre processing steps is `trimmomatic`.

1. Activate Vital-it module `trimmomatic`
```bash
module add UHTS/Analysis/trimmomatic/0.33
```

3. Submit a trimming job (this will take some minutes)
```bash
ISOLATE=<name_of_the_isolate>
bsub -n 8 -M 4194304 -J <job_name> trimmomatic PE -threads 8 \
<input_readsR1.fastq.gz> <input_readsR2.fastq.gz> \
$ISOLATE''_R1t.fq.gz $ISOLATE''_R1np.fq.gz \
$ISOLATE''_R2t.fq.gz $ISOLATE''_R2np.fq.gz \
ILLUMINACLIP:<adapters.fa>:3:25:6 LEADING:9 TRAILING:9 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:60
```

<sub>
Those adapters are comming from situations when a DNA fragment is really small, there can be more consecutive adapters sequenced. Those adapters are not cut in demultiplexing in the sequencing centre. It is up on us, to get rid of them. The most of possible adapters of Illumina sequencing are in the file `<adapters.fa>`. `trimmomatic` cat try to identify those sequences in the reads and cut them off if the module `ILLUMINACLIP` is used. You have to specify the file with adapters. Other modules of trimmomatic, `LEADING`, `TRAILING` are cutting given number bases from the start and end of read if the quality is below some internal threshold. Module `SLIDINGWINDOW` performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. Module `MINLEN` simply discards all reads which are after all that trimming shorter than given number of bases.

## Again quality control

Right now you have to verify, that trimmer have sucessfully trimmed your reads. 

1. activate again module for `fastqc`
2. submit a job computing a quality control of trimmed reads
3. download the `.html` reports and check if reads look better now. What is the distribution of length? How many reads were discarded? Is quality dropout in the tail of reads better now?
