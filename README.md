# Sequence a genome

There are teaching materials for a  class for the fist year master students of molecular life sciences at University of Lausanne. The coure is called Sequence a genome. Students isolate DNA that is then sequenced and then they the rest of the course on analyses of the sequencing output. These materials are covering the introduction to unix and cluster computing with emphasis to common operations used for handing sequencing data. The cluster environment we teach is LSF, but besides that the materials should be rather generic for any bioinformatics/genomics class. All the three autumn semesters got very positive feedback from students. The Rmarkdown files should be possible to render for everyone, the LaTeX presentations are missing all the pictures, if you would be interested in that, let me know. I can upload them somewhere...
