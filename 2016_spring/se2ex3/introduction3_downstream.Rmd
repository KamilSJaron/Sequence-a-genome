</font>

- 26.04. : **Visualisation & downstream analyses**
- 03.05. : Downstream analyses
- 10.05. : Analysis of annotated genes
- 17.05. : Analysis of annotated genes
- 24.05. : Presentations

## Results from last week

Common folders are full of results! Well done, Thank YOU!

- `scripts/` - all scripts and script templates
- `mapping/` - mapping files for IGV (.bam, .bam.bai)
- `abundances/` - read counts

You have two possibilities right now. To use this material to create your own `.Rmd` document or just simple `.R` script. 

## Today

- `IGV` - browsing of mapping
- `R` - downstream analysis

## Your turn...

MyUnil > courses > Sequence a Genome II > RNAseq3_downstream.html

## SPACE FOR SOME MORE EXPLANATION

If we encounter common problem in R, we will modify this slide during class. Presentation online will be updated afterwards.

## Scheduled for the next week

- More analysis of transcript abundancies in R
  
## See you next week

Thank you for your participation!
